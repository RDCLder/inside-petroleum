# Inside Petroleum Full-Stack Application

## Setup

- Go to the directory in which you want to install this application.

- Run the following command in your terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/RDCLder/inside-petroleum.git
    ```

- Once the application has been successfully cloned, run the following commands in the order shown to install all dependencies.
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    ```
    npm run install-frontend
    ```
    ```
    npm run install-backend
    ```

- Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can run the application with the following command.
    ```
    npm start
    ```

- The application should automatically be launched on port 3000.  If port 3000 is occupied, be sure to close any other applications which might be using it.
    - Repeat this step for port 3001 if needed.
    - If port 3000 does not automatically launch, you can manually open it by opening a browser and entering the following URL:
        ```
        localhost:3000
        ```

- Happy hacking!
